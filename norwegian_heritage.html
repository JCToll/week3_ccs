          <h1>Norway - My First Conerstone </h1>
          <p><em>Why is Norway an important conerstone of my heritage?</em></p>
      </header> 
    
      <p>My heritage starts with my maternal grandparents, who were born and grew up on opposite ends of the small island of Andøya, Norway. My grandpa Hjalmar said that as a young boy, he met my grandma Agnes only one time when their two churches joined for the final Confirmation ceremony. He vowed he would someday marry that girl... but then he never saw here again. </p>
      <p>My grandparents both immigrated separately to the United States in early the 1920's. Neither knew that the other had also immigrated.  One day, by sheer coincidence, they bumped into each other on a trolley in the city of Tacoma. They were soon married and settled in Ballard, Seattle. The rest is history...  </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Andøya is the northernmost island in the Vesterålen archipelago, situated about 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of the Arctic circle. Andøya, is the 10th largest island in Norway, and is located in the municipality of Andøy in Nordland county. The island is sparsly populated with only ~ 5,000 residents.  [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And%C3%B8ya target="_blank">[Wikipedia Article]</a>   </p>
        <p> In Norwegian, "and" - means "island", and "øya", means "duck". So,<b> Andøya= Duck Island. </b> </p>
        <p>The numerous bog areas on Andøya are used for the extensive production of peat. Andøya is also well known for its cloudberries. Besides the flat and largely continuous bog areas, Andøya also consists of steep mountain ranges reaching up to 700 metres (2,300 ft) high</p>
        <p>The Andøya Space Center which was founded in 1962 is also located on the island. Since 1962, over 1,200 sounding rockets of all known configurations have been launched from this site.</p>
